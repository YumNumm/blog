import BlogImage from "@components/BlogImage.astro"
import stepone from "@images/step-one.png"
import steptwo from "@images/step-two.png"
import stepthree from "@images/step-three.png"

For this tutorial, I will show you how to create your own blog using this template and deploy it to the internet. I will be using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) as my static hosting because it is what I use for my projects. You can use any static hosting you want. (Not the best instructions I did but at least it helps you get started ðŸ˜…)

## 1. Clone this repository

You can go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lancerossdev/astro-basic-blog) of this template and click the "Use this template" button. After that, clone your forked repository on your local machine using the command below. Make sure to replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and you have the forked repository on your account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/astro-basic-blog.git
```

## 2. Install dependencies and create your content

For that, you need to install the dependencies using `npm install` (or whatever package manager you use) and open a dev server using the `npm run dev` and go to `http://localhost:3000` to your browser. After that, you can now create your content using MDX in the `src/pages/posts` folder. You can also change the design `src/pages/index.astro` file to your liking.

On creating a blog, create a new file ending in `.mdx` in the `src/pages/posts` folder. Make sure to add these contents so that the blog will be shown on the homepage.

```mdx

### Project Filepath

`components` - The components folder of your project. This is where you can add your reusable components to your pages. You can use a JavaScript Framework or Library here if you want.

`pages` - The pages folder of your project. This is where you can add your pages. You can add your blog posts on the `/blog` folder using MDX.

`images` - The images folder of your project. This is where you can add your images. Astro will automagically compress them for you so you don't need to worry about the size of your images and the performance of your site!

## 3. Deploy it to the internet

After you create your content and pushed the code in your repository, you can now deploy it to the internet. I will be using Netlify for this tutorial. You can use any static hosting you want if you want to.

### Before we start

Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and login to your account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free using GitHub or an email and password.

### Step 1

Click the "Add new site" button and select "Import an exisiting project".
<BlogImage src={stepone} alt="Step one" />

### Step 2

Click the "GitHub" button to connect Netlify to your GitHub account.

<BlogImage src={steptwo} alt="Step two" />

### Step 3

Select the repository you want to deploy and click the "Deploy site" button. Netlify does the job automagically for you!

<BlogImage src={stepthree} alt="Step three" />

And there you go, you just created your blog in Astro and also deployed it to the internet. Make sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lancerossdev) for updates about me and [GitHub](https://github.com/lancerossdev) for my latest projects out there!
