Ok, so while editing some stuffs for this blog template, I questioned myself "Why did I create this blog template?". I mean, there are already a lot of blog templates out there made with Astro. So, why did I create this one?

## What is this thing?

This is a basic blog template I did using Astro and Tailwind CSS. It's a simple blog template that you can use to create your own blog. It's not a complex template, but it's a good starting point for you to create your own blog. It is SEO friendly, blazingly fast, has built in RSS Feed, OG Image Generator on Edge when you use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [Cloudflare](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and it's also responsive on most devices.

## Why did you create this template?

Well, I wanted to create a blog template because I want to contribute more on Astro and have a projects to showcase on my portfolio. I wanted a blog template for anyone out there who want to try Astro for the first time. I wanted a blog template that is simple, fast, and easy to use.

## Wow! It looks cool. How did you create this?

I started to create this template by scratch and I was planning to use it with Tailwind CSS. I didn't add any JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries out there because Astro does all the job for you and there are no interactive components here so I don't need it.

Feel free add your own content and customize it to your liking and I hope you enjoy using this template! Make sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lancerossdev) for updates about me and [GitHub](https://github.com/lancerossdev) for my latest projects out there!
